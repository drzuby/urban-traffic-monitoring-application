     * Each could have an possibility to detect an anomaly and what is more important, the ability,
     * to communicate with the data logger.
     * It's due to the fact that we need to have a good data interchange and anomaly detection in real-time.
     * Moreover, the logger should log faster if anomaly detector want this (it want this if first-time anomaly detected).
     * So, this should be like an server application, and logger like a client application.
     * This could be build based on the JGroups architecture.
